# Task 2 Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed: Database Schema and Core Data Models

This task has been successfully implemented with all required components for the SwipeHire Campus database system.

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. Complete Prisma Schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
- **Users table**: Base authentication with email and role
- **Student Profiles**: Skills, projects, optional video URLs
- **Recruiter Profiles**: Organization and title information
- **Jobs**: Postings with skills matching and batch filtering
- **Likes**: User interactions with rate limiting support
- **Matches**: Mutual matching system
- **Slots**: Interview time slot management
- **Interviews**: Booked interview sessions with meeting URLs
- **Exposures**: Content tracking for ranking algorithms
- **Reports**: Content reporting and safety system

### 2. Database Migration Files
- **Initial migration**: `migrations/20241201000000_init/migration.sql`
- **Migration lock**: `migration_lock.toml`
- Complete schema with all tables, indexes, and constraints

### 3. Prisma Client Configuration (`src/lib/prisma.ts`)
- Singleton pattern for connection management
- Development logging configuration
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Global instance prevention in development

### 4. Database Utilities (`src/lib/database.ts`)
- Health check functions
- Database statistics gathering
- Transaction wrapper utilities
- Error handling for common Prisma errors
- Reset functionality for testing

### 5. Seed Data System (`prisma/seed.ts`)
- 5 realistic student profiles with diverse skills
- 3 recruiter profiles from different companies
- 5 job postings with various requirements
- Sample likes, matches, and interview slots
- Test data for exposures and reports
- Proper foreign key relationships

### 6. Database Management Scripts
- `npm run db:generate` - Generate Prisma client
- `npm run db:migrate` - Apply migrations
- `npm run db:push` - Push schema (development)
- `npm run db:seed` - Populate test data
- `npm run db:reset` - Reset database
- `npm run db:setup` - Complete setup automation
- `npm run db:verify` - Verify implementation
- `npm run db:studio` - GUI interface

### 7. Performance Optimizations
- **Indexes** on frequently queried columns:
  - User email, role, creation date
  - Student skills (GIN index for arrays)
  - Job skills, batch, creation date
  - Like relationships and timestamps
  - Match relationships
  - Slot availability and timing
  - Interview status tracking
  - Exposure tracking for ranking
  - Report management

### 8. Data Integrity Features
- **Foreign key constraints** with cascade deletes
- **Unique constraints** to prevent duplicates
- **Enum types** for role and status fields
- **Array support** for skills matching
- **Proper indexing** for performance

### 9. Documentation and Testing
- **DATABASE.md**: Comprehensive setup guide
- **Verification scripts**: Automated testing
- **Error handling**: Structured error responses
- **Health monitoring**: Database status endpoints

## 🔧 Key Technical Features

### Schema Design
- Normalized database structure
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Optimized for ranking algorithms
- Support for mutual matching logic
- Atomic booking operations

### Performance Considerations
- GIN indexes for array fields (skills)
- Composite indexes for common queries
- Efficient pagination support
- Connection pooling ready

### Safety and Reliability
- Cascade delete protection
- Transaction support
- Idempotency constraints
- Data validation at schema level

## 📊 Requirements Coverage

✅ **Requirement 1.1**: User authentication system support
✅ **Requirement 2.1**: Profile management for students and recruiters  
✅ **Requirement 5.1**: Mutual matching system
✅ **Requirement 6.1**: Interview slot management
✅ **Requirement 7.1**: Booking system with atomic operations

## 🚀 Ready for Next Steps

The database foundation is complete and ready for:
1. **Authentication system** (Task 3)
2. **API endpoint development** 
3. **Ranking algorithm implementation**
4. **Real-time matching logic**

## 🧪 Testing Status

- ✅ Schema validation passes
- ✅ Prisma client generation successful
- ✅ Migration files created
- ✅ Seed data comprehensive
- ⏳ Database server connection (requires running PostgreSQL)
